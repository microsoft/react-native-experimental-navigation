#react-native-experimental-navigation
ExperimentalNavigation is a cross-platform app navigation framework.
The code in this repository is based on react-native-experimental-navigation deprecated by facebook. See: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/08dbc43fa64ff1dfc0d364b6cef6262426f76b64 
*Be aware of facebook patent notice if you are using it.*

## Why ExperimentalNavigation
If you need in good low-level navigation framework this library is a good answer. It has a better performance than StandardNavigation framework, though not all of the StandardNavigation features are implemented in particular some of the animations behave differently.

If you are building something new you'd probably better to look at the https://reactnavigation.org/.
